The purpose of this project was to build a gestural media player that could be used by people with certain disabilities or physical limitations as part of our final project for CSE-155 (Human Computer Interaction) at UC Merced. This project was built in collaboration with 2 others and this repository ONLY includes the creation of the media player portion of the code. 
 
The media player is supposed to be connected with a hand tracking API that allows the user to control uploaded MP3 music files using only their hand with specific gestures. The users device uses its camera to track each gesture and includes basic commands for the media player including play, pause, forward and back.
